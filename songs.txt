Beyond the horizon of the place we lived we ware young
In a world of magnets and miracles
Our thoughts strayed constantly and without boundary
The ringing of the division bell had begun

The grass was greener
The light was brighter
With friends surrounded
The nights of wonder

The taste sweeter
The nights of wonder
With friends surrounded
